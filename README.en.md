# Zuolan MCU Peripheral

## Introduction

This project provides examples of commonly used peripheral drivers, such as **DHT11**, **DS18B20**, and **MPU6050**, aiming to help developers quickly get started with these devices.

> **Repository Note**  
> The `./libdriver` resources in this repository are derived from the open-source project [libdriver](https://github.com/libdriver).  
> **Note**: This repository is for sharing and learning purposes only. Some modules (e.g., those prefixed with `mcu`, like OLED and ESP01S) are not yet fully completed. However, they are functional, and only some examples and interfaces are not yet adapted.

## Architecture

This project adopts a modular design, where each peripheral driver is encapsulated in an independent module, offering the following advantages:
- **Ease of Use**: Each module can be used independently in different projects.  
- **Convenient Integration**: Developers can quickly integrate multiple modules to achieve more complex functions.
