## LibDriver LM75B

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/lm75b/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The LM75B is a temperature-to-digital converter using an on-chip band gap temperature sensor and Sigma-Delta A-to-D conversion technique with an overtemperature detection output. The LM75B contains a number of data registers: Configuration register (Conf) to store the device settings such as device operation mode, OS operation mode, OS polarity and OS fault queue as described in the datasheet.Temperature register (Temp) to store the digital temp reading, and set-point registers (Tos and Thyst) to store programmable overtemperature shutdown and hysteresis limits, that can be communicated by a controller via the 2-wire serial I2C-bus interface. The device also includes an open-drain output (OS) which becomes active when the temperature exceeds the programmed limits. There are three selectable logic address pins so that eight devices can be connected on the same bus without address conflict.The LM75B can be configured for different operation conditions. It can be set in normal mode to periodically monitor the ambient temperature, or in shutdown mode to minimize power consumption. The OS output operates in either of two selectable modes:OS comparator mode or OS interrupt mode. Its active state can be selected as either HIGH or LOW. The fault queue that defines the number of consecutive faults in order to activate the OS output is programmable as well as the set-point limits. The temperature register always stores an 11-bit two’s complement data giving a temperature resolution of 0.125 C. This high temperature resolution is particularly useful in applications of measuring precisely the thermal drift or runaway. When the LM75B is accessed the conversion in process is not interrupted (that is, the I2C-bus section is totally independent of the Sigma-Delta converter section) and accessing the LM75B continuously without waiting at least one conversion time between communications will not prevent the device from updating the Temp register with a new conversion result. The new conversion result will be available immediately after the Temp register is updated. The LM75B powers up in the normal operation mode with the OS in comparator mode,temperature threshold of 80 C and hysteresis of 75 C, so that it can be used as a stand-alone thermostat with those pre-defined temperature set points.LM75B is used in system thermal management, personal computer, electronic equipment and industrial controller.

LibDriver LM75B is the full function driver of LM75B launched by LibDriver.It provides functions such as temperature reading and interrupt detection. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_lm75b_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float t;

res = lm75b_basic_init(LM75B_ADDRESS_A000);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    lm75b_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    res = lm75b_basic_read((float *)&t);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)lm75b_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    lm75b_interface_debug_print("lm75b: temperature is %0.3fC.\n", t);

    ...
    
}

...

(void)lm75b_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example interrupt

```C
#include "driver_lm75b_interrupt.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float t;
uint8_t g_flag;

res = gpio_interrupt_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}
res = lm75b_interrupt_init(LM75B_ADDRESS_A000, LM75B_OS_OPERATION_INTERRUPT, 22.5, 32.1);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)gpio_interrupt_deinit();

    return 1;
}

...
    
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    lm75b_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    res = lm75b_interrupt_read((float *)&t);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)gpio_interrupt_deinit();
        (void)lm75b_interrupt_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    lm75b_interface_debug_print("lm75b: read is %0.3fC.\n", t);
    
    ...
    
    if (g_flag != 0)
    {
        lm75b_interface_debug_print("lm75b: find interrupt.\n");

        break;
    }
    
    ...
    
}

...

(void)gpio_interrupt_deinit();
(void)lm75b_interrupt_deinit();

return 0;
```
