## LibDriver JED1XX

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/jed1xx/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

Digital gas sensor is a low-power, miniaturized sensor. Combining semiconductor gas sensors with high-performance microprocessors for detecting gas concentrations in the environment. High sensitivity, compact and precise, using I2C digital signal output method, convenient for users to use and debug, greatly shortening the user's design and development cycle. It can be widely applied in many fields such as environmental safety, portable instruments, etc.

LibDriver JED1XX is the full function driver of JED1XX launched by LibDriver.It provides the function of reading data. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver JED1XX source files.

/interface includes LibDriver JED1XX IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver JED1XX driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver JED1XX sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver JED1XX offline document.

/datasheet includes JED1XX datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_jed1xx_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
float ppm;

/* basic init */
res = jed1xx_basic_init(JED1XX_TYPE_101_VOC);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* loop */
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* delay 3000ms */
    jed1xx_interface_delay_ms(3000);

    /* read data */
    res = jed1xx_basic_read(&ppm);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)jed1xx_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    jed1xx_interface_debug_print("jed1xx: %d/%d.\n", (uint32_t)(i + 1), (uint32_t)3);
    jed1xx_interface_debug_print("jed1xx: output is %0.1fppm.\n", ppm);
    
    ...
}

...
    
/* deinit */
(void)jed1xx_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
