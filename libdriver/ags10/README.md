## LibDriver AGS10

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/ags10/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

AGS10 is a high-performance TVOC sensor which is equipped with a dedicated ASIC chip, adopting special digital module acquisition technology and gas sensing technology, to ensure good performance of high reliability, long-term stability, low power consumption, high sensitivity. Output signal of AGS10 is standard I²C. Each sensor is fully calibrated and tested before delivery to meet the large-scale applications of customers.

LibDriver AGS10 is the full function driver of AGS10 launched by LibDriver.It provides the function of reading TVOC, etc. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver AGS10 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver AGS10 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver AGS10 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver AGS10 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver AGS10 offline document.

/datasheet includes AGS10 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_ags10_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
uint32_t ppb;

/* basic init */
res = ags10_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* loop */
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* delay 2000ms */
    ags10_interface_delay_ms(2000);

    /* read data */
    res = ags10_basic_read((uint32_t *)&ppb);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)ags10_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    ags10_interface_debug_print("ags10: %d/%d.\n", (uint32_t)(i + 1), (uint32_t)3);
    ags10_interface_debug_print("ags10: tvoc is %dppb.\n", ppb);
    
    ...
}

...
    
/* deinit */
(void)ags10_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
